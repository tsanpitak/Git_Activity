How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?


Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
Lending Club came out as an innovative company that linked borrowers to lenders. Borrowers fill out an online application, and are approved or denied in seconds. If approved, funding to borrowers is done in less than a week and borrowers never have to set foot in a bank. With the advent of Lending Club and many other online lenders, I believe this will be a growing industry. It is hard to imagine that customers who experience a service like online lending, ever going back to a traditional bank. I believe that online lending is the future and institutions that don’t adjust to this reality will give up market share to companies like Lending Club.

There are many headwinds to Lending Club’s future. One of them is competition. Another headwind that LC may face is funding volatility. The Laplanche scandal revealed an Achilles heel that Lending Club possesses in spite of its innovation. Funding investors for Lending Club have shown that they will not hesitate to pull funds if things take a turn for the worse. A future event, such as a major economic downturn, can cause a large segment of the unsecured loans to default.

What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?
I believe Lending Club can do more to become a solid long term investment. My suggestion is to control loan disbursements for consolidation loans. In the case of borrowers with heavy credit card use, Lending Club needs to unsure that the funds issued to borrowers for consolidation are used for that purpose. LC can ensure this happens by sending the payoff amounts appearing on the borrowers’ credit bureau directly to the credit card companies before dispersing remaining funds (if any) to the borrowers’ checking accounts.
